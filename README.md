# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict wine quality based on physicochemical tests. It uses the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) and applies classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost.

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing & visualization
- Binary classification (Good vs Bad wine)
- Model evaluation with ROC AUC and confusion matrix

## 📁 Files
- `wine_quality.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `winequality.csv`: Dataset
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries needed

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Install Jupyter and required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
